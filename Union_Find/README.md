## Redundant Connection ######################
We‚Äôre given an undirected graph consisting of ùëõ nodes. The graph is represented as list called edges, of length ùëõ, where edges[i] = [a, b] indicates that there is an edge between nodes a and b in the graph. Return an edge that can be removed to make the graph a tree of ùëõ nodes. If there are multiple candidates for removal, return the edge that occurs last in edges.

## Number of Islands ########################
Let‚Äôs consider a scenario with an (ùëö√óùëõ) 2D grid containing binary numbers, where '0' represents water and '1' represents land. If any '1' cells are connected to each other horizontally or vertically (not diagonally), they form an island. Your task is to return the total number of islands in the grid.

## Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column ################
 The goal is to find the maximum number of stones that can be removed while ensuring that at least one stone remains in each connected component of stones.

Offset Explanation:

The offset ensures that the row indices and column indices do not overlap in the Union-Find structure. By adding a large constant (100,000) to the column index, we effectively create a unique namespace for columns distinct from the rows.
This allows us to treat each stone's row and column as unique elements in the Union-Find structure, ensuring proper union operations without index collisions.

Let's run through the example stones = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 3]].
Union Operations: use the Union-Find data structure to connect stones in the same row or column into disjoint sets

Union (0, 0+100000) => Union (0, 100000)
Union (0, 1+100000) => Union (0, 100001)
Union (1, 2+100000) => Union (1, 100002)
Union (2, 2+100000) => Union (2, 100002)
Union (3, 3+100000) => Union (3, 100003)

Counting Groups:

After all union operations, the groups are:
Group 1: {0, 100000, 100001}
Group 2: {1, 2, 100002}
Group 3: {3, 100003}
Total unique groups: 3

Removable Stones Calculation:

Total stones = 5
Total groups = 3
Removable stones = 5 - 3 = 2

## Longest Consecutive Sequence #################
Given an unsorted array, nums, your task is to return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements. The consecutive sequence of elements is such that there are no missing elements in the sequence. The consecutive elements can be present anywhere in the input array.

## Last Day Where You Can Still Cross ###############

In our solution, we‚Äôll look for a single component of connected water cells from the left to the right of matrix, on each day. Once encountered, we‚Äôll return this day as the last day where we can still cross matrix.

 when checking whether two water cells are connected, we need to check in eight directions: up, down, left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, and down-right.

## Regions Cut by Slashes ##########################
An n√ón grid is composed of ùëõ, 1√ó1 squares, where each 1√ó1 square consists of a ‚Äú/‚Äù, ‚Äú\‚Äù, or a blank space. These characters divide the square into adjacent regions.

Given the grid represented as a string array, return the number of adjacent regions.

solution:

1- The idea is to divide each 1√ó1 box in the grid into four regions representing its north, west, east, and south regions.

2- At the start, an n√ón grid will contain (4√ón√ón) regions.

3- We will gradually reduce the number of regions by merging the regions inside each box based on the character they contain and

4- then connecting them with their neighboring boxes (on it‚Äôs top, bottom, left, and right). 
    The north region of the current box connects with the south region of the box above it.

    The south region of the current box connects with the north region of the box below it.

    The west region of the current box connects with the east region of the box to its left.

    The east region of the current box connects with the west region of the box to its right.

5- This merging and connecting will be done using the union find algorithm.
