Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Statement
Given an array where the element at the index i represents the price of a stock on day i, find the maximum profit that you can gain by buying the stock once and then selling it.
We canâ€™t sell before buying a stock, that is, the array index at which stock is bought will always be less than the index at which the stock is sold.
